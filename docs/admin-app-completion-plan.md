# Smart Queue — Admin App Completion Plan

Date: 2026-03-04

---

## Workflow Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Branch per phase** — At the start of each phase, create a feature branch from the current working branch (e.g. `feature/admin-auth`, `feature/admin-rbac`). **Never push directly to `main`.**
2. **Update this document** — At the end of each phase, update this plan: mark all completed todos with ✅ and note the completion date.
3. **Review gate** — After finishing a phase, pause for user review. Do not commit or push until the user explicitly approves.
4. **Commit & push on approval** — Only commit and push to the feature branch when the user says so. Never merge into `main` — merges are handled separately via PR.

## Current State Assessment

The admin app has a **production-quality shell** with zero business logic:

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Routing & resource declaration (6 tabs) | Done |
| Sidebar + header + breadcrumb layout | Done |
| Theme system (light/dark/system) | Done |
| Notification system (Sonner) | Done |
| 46 shadcn/ui primitives | Done |
| Refine CRUD primitives (DataTable, buttons, views) | Done |
| REST data provider (`@refinedev/rest`) | Configured, unused |
| Auth forms (login, change-password) | ✅ Implemented (Phase A) |
| **Auth provider (Refine `authProvider`)** | ✅ Implemented (Phase A) |
| **Access control provider (RBAC)** | **Not implemented** |
| **WebSocket / realtime integration** | **Not implemented** |
| **i18n (Arabic/English)** | **Not configured** |
| **All 6 page bodies** | **Empty stubs** |

### Backend Endpoint Availability

## Completion Phases

### Phase A — Authentication & Session Management ✅
**Goal:** Wire login, token management, and session lifecycle into Refine.

**Priority:** Highest — blocks everything else.

**Completed:** 2026-03-04

**Todos:**
1. ✅ **Create `authProvider`** for Refine that calls `POST /auth/login`, stores JWT access token in memory and refresh token in localStorage, and returns user identity with role. Role enforcement blocks Staff from admin app.
2. ✅ **Wire `<Authenticated>` wrapper** around the `<Layout>` so unauthenticated users redirect to `/login`.
3. ✅ **Create `/login` route** — bespoke login page with Smart Queue branding, error handling (invalid credentials, account locked, rate limit).
4. ✅ **Implement token refresh logic** — intercept 401 responses via mutex pattern in `apiFetch()`, call `POST /auth/refresh`, retry the original request. Silent refresh in `check()` on page reload.
5. ✅ **Create `/change-password` route** — forced flow for `mustChangePassword` users with strength indicators and client-side validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol).
6. ✅ **Add logout flow** — best-effort `POST /auth/logout`, clear tokens + stored user, redirect to `/login`.
7. ✅ **Store user identity** (id, email, role, departmentId, mustChangePassword) in Refine's `getIdentity` via `stored-user.ts` for downstream RBAC and scoping.

**Backend dependencies:** None — all auth endpoints exist.

**Branch:** `feature/admin-auth`

---

### Phase B — RBAC & Access Control
**Goal:** Enforce role-based tab visibility and page-level access.

**Priority:** High — must follow immediately after auth.

**Todos:**
1. **Create `accessControlProvider`** for Refine implementing the RBAC matrix:
   - Admin → all 6 tabs
   - IT → User Experience + Mapping only
   - Manager → Queue Control + Analytics only
   - Block access server-side AND client-side
2. **Filter sidebar items** — use `useCanAccess` (or equivalent) to conditionally render sidebar links per role.
3. **Add route guards** — redirect to an "unauthorized" page if a user navigates to a forbidden tab.
4. **Scope Manager data** — inject the manager's `departmentId` into all data fetches so they only see their own department.
5. **Create a simple "Unauthorized" page** for forbidden access attempts.

**Backend dependencies:** None — role is returned in the login response, RBAC is enforced server-side on every API call.

**Branch:** `feature/admin-rbac`

---

### Phase C — Queue Control Page
**Goal:** Live queue dashboard with ticket lookup and priority change.

**Priority:** High — core operational tab for Admin + Manager.

**Todos:**
1. **Department selector** (Admin: all departments dropdown; Manager: auto-locked to assigned department).
2. **Service selector** scoped to the selected department (calls `GET /departments/:id/services`).
3. **Queue status widgets** — display waiting, in-progress, serving, completed, no-show counts (calls `GET /queue/services/:serviceId/summary`).
4. **Now-serving indicator** — show the ticket currently being served at each counter.
5. **WebSocket integration** — subscribe to `queue.updated` events for the selected service; auto-refresh summary on change.
6. **Waiting list table** — display the ordered waiting queue (calls `GET /queue/services/:serviceId/waiting`) with columns: position, ticket number, phone, priority, wait time.
7. **Ticket lookup** — search by ticket number or phone number.
   - *Backend dependency:* `GET /tickets/:ticketId` or a search endpoint — **needs backend work or client-side filter on waiting list**.
8. **Ticket detail panel** — read-only fields + audit trail preview.
   - *Backend dependency:* ticket detail endpoint — **needs backend work**.
9. **Priority change flow:**
   - Lock the ticket (`POST /queue/tickets/:ticketId/lock`) — **needs backend work**.
   - Show priority change UI (Normal / VIP / Emergency).
   - Submit change — can reuse `POST /teller/change-priority` for now.
   - Audit trail recorded server-side.
10. **Enforce rule:** priority change blocked if ticket status ≠ WAITING (UI + server).

**Backend dependencies (new endpoints needed):**
- `GET /tickets/:ticketId` — ticket detail lookup
- `GET /tickets?phone=...` — ticket search by phone
- `POST /queue/tickets/:ticketId/lock` — ticket locking
- `POST /queue/tickets/:ticketId/unlock` — ticket unlock

                                    Phase K (Polish)
```

**Critical path:** A → B → C (Queue Control is the first user-facing deliverable after auth).

Phases C through H can be developed **in parallel** once B is complete, subject to backend endpoint availability. Recommended sequencing by backend readiness:

| Order | Phase | Backend Ready? |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | A — Auth | Yes |
| 2 | B — RBAC | Yes |
| 3 | C — Queue Control | Partially (need ticket lookup + lock) |
| 4 | D — Organization | Partially (transfer reasons ready; user mgmt + org metadata need backend work) |
| 5 | E — Dept Structure | Needs CRUD endpoints |
| 6 | F — User Experience | Needs patient text config endpoint |
| 7 | G — Mapping | Needs device registry endpoints |
| 8 | H — Analytics | Needs analytics endpoints |
| 9 | I — i18n | Independent |
| 10 | J — Realtime | Independent (after C) |
| 11 | K — Polish | Last |

---

## Mock Provider Strategy

For pages where backend endpoints are not yet available, follow the project's **data provider switching pattern**:

1. Create a `mock` data provider that returns contract-shaped responses.
2. Create an `http` data provider that calls the real backend.
3. Switch via `VITE_DATA_PROVIDER=mock|http` environment variable.
4. Mock responses must respect domain rules (RBAC scopes, queue constraints, error codes).

This allows UI development to proceed **without blocking on backend delivery**.

---

## Estimated Effort Summary

| Phase | Estimated Effort | Backend Work Needed |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| A — Auth | 2–3 days | None |
| B — RBAC | 1–2 days | None |
| C — Queue Control | 3–5 days | Ticket lookup + lock endpoints |
| D — Organization | 4–6 days | User CRUD + org metadata endpoints |
| E — Dept Structure | 3–4 days | Dept/service CRUD endpoints |
| F — User Experience | 2–3 days | Minimal (patient text config) |
| G — Mapping | 3–4 days | Device registry endpoints |
| H — Analytics | 4–6 days | Analytics endpoints |
| I — i18n | 2–3 days | None |
| J — Realtime | 2–3 days | None |
| K — Polish | 3–5 days | None |
| **Total** | **~29–44 days** | |
